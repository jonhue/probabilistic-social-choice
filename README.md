# Probabilistic Social Choice

These are the slides of a talk targeted at a wider audience I gave at the Computational Social Choice seminar at ETH Zurich.

It is about the great paper ["Consistent Probabilistic Social Choice"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.00694) by Florian Brandl, Felix Brandt, and Hans Georg Seedig.

It turns out that in many scenarios, lotteries over alternatives are a great method to achieve _ex ante_ fairness given that preferences are aggregated repeatedly. In the talk, we discuss the theoretical findings of the paper as well as their wider implications.
